Thanks for purchasing 2D Fluid Surface.

Visit scene called Demo and hit play. Now you see 4 waves. They are all controlled by the same script with different properties.

For using asset in your project do the following:
1) Drag one of the prefabs in your scene.
2) Adjust the WaveMesh.cs properties to your liking.
3) Assign a material to Mesh Renderer.

If you want to add a collider to the wave do the following:
1) Add a WaveCollider.cs to the wave gameobject.
Note: Recreating a collider each frame is causing high cpu usage. Try to lower the pointConcetration for better performance.
